# geom_cast

Author: Daniel Maturana (`dimatura@cmu.edu`)

Maintainer: Daniel Maturana (`dimatura@cmu.edu`)

Clean conversion between different point and rotation types used throughout ROS.
Conversion is type-safe and has NO performance penalty relative to manual conversion.

Supports Eigen, tf, geometry_msgs.

See also: `geom_cast_extra`, with additional conversions (OpenCV, pcl).



# TODO

- Use C++11 features
- More types: std::vector, KDL, std::array
- Types with timestamps?
- Extensibility?
- Anything new for tf2?
